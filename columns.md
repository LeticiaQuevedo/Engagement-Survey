I am proud to work at AP
I would recommend AP to my friends or colleagues as a great place to work
I rarely think about looking for a job at another company
I see myself still working here in two years' time
AP motivates me to go beyond what I would in a similar role elsewhere
Communication from leadership is frequent and transparent
The leaders in my organization provide clear direction and guidelines for the future
I receive regular, constructive feedback from my manager
I feel supported and comfortable approaching my manager with concerns and constructive feedback
I am satisfied with my job overall
My workload is manageable and realistic while continuing to challenge and stimulate me
I often feel like I'm just checking tasks as done instead of creating meaningful impact (reverse scored)
I feel comfortable with our unlimited PTO policy and taking time off when I need it
I have access to the things I need to do my job well
Most of the systems and processes here support us getting our work done effectively
I feel empowered to bring new ideas to the team
I can voice a contrary opinion without fear of negative consequences
I know what I need to do to be successful in my role
I understand how my work contributes to company goals
Quality and improvement are top priorities when making decisions
When I need to work with other areas (EPD, GTM, Ops, Support), the collaboration is smooth and productive
I receive appropriate recognition when I do good work
I am satisfied with the current performance review process and career progression
I have access to the learning and development I need to do my job well
My manager (or someone in management) has shown a genuine interest in my career aspirations
I feel that my voice and opinions are heard and valued by my leadership and peers
I feel psychologically safe to take risks, make mistakes and learn from them
AP is dedicated to diversity and inclusiveness
AP demonstrates a commitment to the wellbeing of employees
I understand the AP values
How would you describe the current company culture?
I am satisfied with my current compensation
I understand our benefits policy
I am satisfied with my current benefits package
