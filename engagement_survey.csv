- We do a great job supporting each other and working as a team to achieve our goals, again wether its internally among one team or cross departmental. Feels like even though we have our individual targets, we're still all focused on the big picture. 

- We should take another look at base salary with us moving to a hybrid work schedule vs. remote as additional expenses are now being incurred.
- Large expenses for conferences (things like flights) should not be fronted by reps and should be put on some sort of company card, especially as they can get quite costly. 

- Look into possibility of ramp programs for those looking to get promoted to new titles.

I think we do a really great job at hiring and making sure the people brought onboard would be good for the culture and provide positivity and energy to create something big together. I love that Baxter includes us on the Alt journey and wants us to be included on the growth and success. Maybe an improvement could be something like having an SE or some sort of liason locally that works with the Engineers and that also has access to the backend.

Benefits Package â€“ Offering a more comprehensive benefits package would make a big difference. Now that we are back in the office, a transportation allowance or meal allowance would help offset daily costs.

Retirement Planning â€“ Introducing a pension plan (such as RRSP contributions) would provide long-term financial security and align with what many companies already offer.

Compensation Structure â€“ Most companies provide annual salary increases, but this is currently missing. Implementing yearly salary reviews and increases would help employees feel valued and rewarded for their contributions.

Annual Bonus Program â€“ A performance-based annual bonus structure (or another form of yearly compensation in addition to salary) would motivate employees and acknowledge achievements.

Career Growth & Development â€“ Building a clear structure for career progression within the company would help employees envision their long-term future here.

Learning & Development â€“ Establish programs for continuous learning, such as training, certifications, conferences, or workshops. This would help teams stay current with industry trends and sharpen their skills.

Investment in Tools & Resources â€“ Continued investment in software, resources, and people is essential to support teams in performing their roles efficiently and effectively.

Company Outings/Activities â€“ Whenever possible, team outings or special activities should take place during business hours to respect personal time and work-life balance.

Work-from-Office Policy â€“ Reconsider the Toronto office requirement. Limiting in-office days to a maximum of two per week would create more fairness, especially since half of the company works remotely from Brazil, some work remotely from Vancouver, and many Ontario-based employees live two hours away from downtown Toronto.","Commercial, Operations & Support"

- Official remote work policy: One of the benefits of joining AP was the flexibility of being fully remote. Having an official policy in place would help everyone understand expectations while maintaining the ability to travel and work from different locations.
- Small product improvements: While weâ€™ve made huge strides in developing exciting new features, some of the basics can be overlooked. Prioritizing smaller, high-impact improvements would go a long way. For example, adding the ability to search by invoice number within transactions or improving overall search functionality.
- Career growth: Providing clear career paths, including opportunities to transition into other departments, would help employees see a future with the company and plan their growth.
- Bonus structures: Establishing transparent bonus structures would be a great way to reward performance and motivate the team.
Company meet-ups: When weâ€™re all together, it would be valuable to have more structured offsites with intentional planning and activities to make the most of our time in person. Most of the time we spend it doing presentations, and I think people would enjoy using that time to actually hang out and get to know each other.
